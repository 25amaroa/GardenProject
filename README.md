# GardenProject
CS3380 Final Database Project

Hello! This is my garden database project I worked on for phase 3. The database itself is quick simple I created it in mysql. For the application part I decided to use the language python.

Phase 3 instructions:
1. Implement the relational database schema that you developed in Phase 2 using an open
source RDBMS such as MySQL.
2. Ensure that your relation schemas conform to the third normal form (3NF).
3. Populate the tables with synthetic data of your choice.
4. Develop an application (in a programming language of your choice) that will implement
the functions that you have proposed in Phase a. Your application must establish a
connection to the RDBMS, pose the necessary SQL queries, and display the results to an
end-user.
5. Submit your source code and a README file on how to setup and deploy your
application.
6. You will demonstrate your application to the TAs for grading. (The grading schedule will
be posted soon.)

Presentation instructions:
1. Explain why your relation schemas are in 3NF [ explain using the schema diagram modified in 3NF ] (~1 min) -- 10 points
2. Demonstrate how you create the database/tables and populate the tables for your application (~1 minute) (10 points)
3. Demonstrate your application’s first functionality (~2 minutes) (10 points)
4. Demonstrate your application’s second functionality (~2 minutes)—10 points
5. Demonstrate your application’s third functionality (~2 minutes)—10 points
